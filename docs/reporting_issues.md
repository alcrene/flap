# Reporting Issues

The simplest way to contribute is to try FLaP and to report bugs, issues, missing feature or just typos. 
This **really** helps a lot. Thanks to all those who already did.

If FLaP does not fit your needs&mdash;whether it crashes or produces something you do 
not except&mdash;just report the issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/fchauvel/flap/issues). 

If you think someone else might have already reported the same issue,
just drop us a line and we will let you know if it was 
already reported. Use our  [FLaP mailing list](mailto:flap-general@freelists.org). Note that you must
subscribe first by sending an email to 'flap-general-request@freelists.org' with 'subscribe' in the Subject field OR by
visiting [our subscription page](http://www.freelists.org/list/flap-general).

## What to Report?
In order to be best able to fix the issue you face, we need to know in detail
the way you used FLaP. For instance,

 * What is your operating system, which version and which architecture (e.g., Windows7 64bit)?
 * What version of FLaP are you running?
 * Do your LaTeX projects contain specific packages/commands that you need FLaP to detect and process?
 * What happened exactly, what error have you got?
